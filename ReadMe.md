# Spectral-Clustering-API

## Description

The `Spectral-Clustering-API` project implements an API for spectral clustering, a machine learning technique used for grouping data points when the clusters are not linearly separable. Utilizing the eigenvalues of similarity matrices for dimensionality reduction, this API offers a powerful tool for data analysis across various applications, from image segmentation to social network analysis. This project demonstrates my capabilities in applying advanced machine learning algorithms and providing user-friendly interfaces for complex data processing tasks.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Languages: [Specify languages used, e.g., Python, Java]
- Libraries/Frameworks: [e.g., NumPy for numerical operations, SciPy for scientific computing]
- Tools: Git for version control

## Features

- **Spectral Clustering Implementation**: Leverages eigenvalue decomposition for clustering data points based on their similarities.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space for more efficient clustering.
- **API Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive API for users to perform spectral clustering on their datasets.
- **Flexible Similarity Measures**: Supports various measures of similarity to accommodate different types of data and clustering objectives.
- **Scalability**: Designed to efficiently handle large datasets without compromising on performance.
